"""Author the bundled pack's generated sprite art: the cutaway profile's `@Nx`
pieces (N = `S`), and the 1x pieces drawn from the same layout: the classic
profile's desks, the cutaway's base-density back-view sofa, and the city's
building bases.

Draws in PALETTE-KEY space, so the output is .sprite text and the recolor keys
(H/B/S/P and their [ramps] shades) survive per-agent recoloring. The .sprite
files it writes are committed; edit this, not them, and rerun:

    just gen-art

`--check` writes nothing and fails if a sprite it draws is missing or differs
from the committed one, or if a sprite carrying the provenance line is no longer
drawn here (a write deletes those).

It resolves no colour itself: the engine owns the palette and its ramps, so look
at the result through the real renderer: `cargo run --release --example
cutaway_snapshot -- <out.png>` for the `@Nx` art (`--scale 1` for the base-density
sofa), `cargo run --release --example snapshot -- --crop-furniture desk <out.png>`
for the 1x desk.
