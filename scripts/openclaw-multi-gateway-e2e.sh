# OpenClaw MULTI-GATEWAY live-e2e — N REAL `openclaw gateway run` processes, each in
# its own isolated state dir on its own port, all feeding ONE headless pixtuoid; kill
# one and only ITS `daemons=[…]` row goes down.
#
# The sibling scripts are hermetic or model-burning; this one runs a REAL gateway with
# ZERO model calls, the only way to check that the config keys `pixtuoid connect
# openclaw` writes are the keys OpenClaw actually reads, and that N mascots coexist on
# the ONE ground floor they share — the crowding where a 4-gateway render was found
# drawing only 3 lobsters.
#
# NOT a CI test (needs a real `openclaw` on PATH), but side-effect-free: every gateway
# runs from a throwaway `OPENCLAW_HOME`.
#
# Build first:  just build --release
# Run:          scripts/openclaw-multi-gateway-e2e.sh [port ...]   (default: 4 ports)
