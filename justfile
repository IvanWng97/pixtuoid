#   site     — the Astro landing page under site/ (npm + the wasm build)
#   gen      — regenerate + check committed artifacts
#   release  — what release.yml builds and checks: the cross builds, the .deb,
#              the version read, and the Node gates (npm-check)
#   meta     — tooling setup, the local gate (preflight), the fixture
#              gates, and the gates' selftests

# Doc-rendering gate. Two things `cargo build`/`clippy`/`nextest` can't see:
# (1) build every item's docs, private ones included, with EVERY rustdoc
# warning as an error — rustdoc resolves links only on the items it renders, so
# a public-only build lets a private item's links rot unseen, while
# `private_intra_doc_links` still fires on a public doc naming a private item
# (the link docs.rs would render broken). The broken/private intra-doc-link
# classes are already `deny` in `[workspace.lints.rustdoc]`; `-D warnings` adds
# bare URLs, invalid HTML, redundant links, and any future rustdoc lint. "Every
# item" spans every unit rustdoc renders: the `pixtuoid` bin, the examples, and
# each `DOC_TARGETS` triple, whose `cfg` arms the host pass compiles out
# (`cfg(target_os = "linux")` arms render only in CI); (2) RUN the doctests —
