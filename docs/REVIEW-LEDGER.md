# REVIEW-LEDGER — adjudicated whole-codebase-review findings

The institutional record of every adjudicated review finding (confirmed, refuted,
accepted-as-residual) from the whole-codebase reviews and review-shaped arcs.
Purpose: future reviews stop re-paying for the same refutations — and stop
trusting stale ones. A refutation is a claim about the code **as it stood at a
HEAD**; the code moves, so this ledger is premise-anchored: every row carries
the seam, the exact claim, the anchor paths/mechanism the verdict rested on,
and the HEAD it was rendered at.

## Usage protocol (for every future review run)

1. **Dedup stage**: match each candidate finding against this ledger by
   **seam + claim** (not seam alone — see Notable flips below).
2. **A match against a REFUTED row does NOT kill the candidate — it DEMOTES
   it.** Run `git diff <verdict-head>..HEAD -- <anchor paths>`. If the anchors
   changed, the entry is **EXPIRED** for this candidate: full verification,
   with the old entry attached as context only. If the anchors are unchanged,
   route the candidate to a single cheap checker agent asking exactly: *"does
   the cited mechanism still refute THIS claim?"* The June-9/June-10
   socket-steal case (below) is WHY: same seam, different claim — one refuted,
   one REAL.
3. **Tiering**: only verdicts citing a documented sharp edge or a merged PR
   get the demote fast-path (**tier A**). Judgment-call verdicts
   ("accepted residual", grouped-summary rows, reconstructed mechanisms) are
   **tier B** = always fully re-verify.
4. **A match against a CONFIRMED-fixed row becomes a regression check**:
   verify the fix PR's mechanism is still present at the anchor paths — not a
   re-derivation of the original bug.
5. **Every NEW design-intent refutation MUST cite an existing sharp edge**
   (workspace or nested `CLAUDE.md`, or an in-code WHY doc) **or add one in
   the same PR**. No undocumented refutations enter this ledger.
6. **Append-only.** A flipped verdict appends a superseding row that links the
   old one; the old row is never edited or deleted.
7. **After adjudication, append**: a new dated `##` section, one row per
   adjudicated finding (same 8 columns), ID prefix `RMMDD-NN` (date-based);
   grouped rows only where individual claims weren't preserved (those are
   tier B by definition).
8. **Calibration**: every Nth review runs ledger-blind. A finding the ledger
   would have demoted but the blind run confirms = a false suppression —
   record the rate in `docs/review-metrics/`.

Head notation: `(n/r)` = HEAD not recorded in the backfill source — treat
anchor expiry as tier B.

Verdict vocabulary: `CONFIRMED→PR#N` (optionally via a deferral issue),
`REFUTED-design` (matched documented intent), `REFUTED-wrong-premise`
(the claim's factual premise was false), `ACCEPTED-residual` (real, consciously
not fixed; WHY documented).

## Notable flips — premise drift in action

**The socket-steal seam (`crates/pixtuoid-core/src/source/hook/unix.rs`,
liveness arbitration) — the canonical example.** Same seam, three adjudications
in three days (plus the documented mixed-version residual), verdicts in both directions:

1. *2026-06-09 review @151e38d* — a socket-steal-shaped candidate at this seam
   fell into the refuted set (the then-current stale-socket reclaim was the
   documented design). Not individually preserved — it lives only in the
   grouped 26-refuted record (row R0609-17), which is exactly the
   record-keeping failure this ledger exists to fix.
2. *External review finding #11* — CONFIRMED: the bind path **silently stole a
   live daemon's transport**, and the alternative bail killed the whole CC
   source. Fixed in PR #232 (connect-errno probe → typed `SocketBusy` →
   transcript-only degradation). Merged 2026-06-11T02:31Z.
3. *2026-06-10 review @7bc2777 — hours after #232 merged* — CONFIRMED
   (MEDIUM): **the probe itself misclassifies**. The repo's own kernel note
   (`pixtuoid-hook/tests/shim.rs` stalled-listener test) documents that a
   backlog-saturated LIVE daemon yields `ECONNREFUSED` on macOS / `EAGAIN` on
   Linux — so the errno probe steals from a live-but-saturated owner. Fixed in
   PR #235: exclusive advisory lock on a sibling `<sock>.lock` held for the
   daemon's lifetime; connect errnos never decide liveness for a lock-holding
   owner (now a sharp edge in `crates/pixtuoid-core/CLAUDE.md`'s `hook/`
   entry, with the mixed-version lock-less residual honestly documented).

   Lesson: a refuted match must be **demoted, not killed** — and a *fix* is
   itself a premise that the next review may legitimately overturn.

**Two grounded sibling examples (same seam, different claim, opposite
verdicts):**

- *Install lock* (`crates/pixtuoid/src/install/io.rs`): June-9 REFUTED
  "advisory `try_lock` fail-on-contention is a bug" (it is documented design —
  io.rs doc: "FAIL on contention rather than block"); the external review
  CONFIRMED "the lock doesn't cover the whole read→merge→write round"
  (lost-update TOCTOU) → PR #229's `ConfigLock` RAII. Both verdicts correct.
- *Resurrect-in-place* (`state/fsm.rs` + reducer): June-9 REFUTED
  "resurrect-in-place active_tasks bypass" (matched a documented edge) while
  the SAME review CONFIRMED "resurrect drops the open Active span" → PR #210;
  then the external review CONFIRMED a third claim — "resurrect leaves the
  dead life's correlation state, suppressing the new life's hooks" → PR #232.
  Three claims, one seam, three different correct verdicts.

## 2026-06-12 — Phase-2 A/B experiment @ a8aaae9 (source/ module) → issue #262

Source: the ledger's first controlled A/B run (its control arm doubles as
the ledger-blind calibration pass — protocol step 8)
([`phase2-ab-2026-06.md`](review-metrics/phase2-ab-2026-06.md), workflow
`wf_04e5f98b-735`): every candidate adjudicated twice — a full skeptic+trace
pair in the control arm, and the ledger-routed treatment arm (full pair for
the 9 unmatched candidates; ONE cheap regression-checker for routed C08).
The run also re-executed the regression-check on R0610-01 +
SUB-01/04/05/06/07 + GEO-01/02 — all fix mechanisms verified present at
a8aaae9 by each of C08's three adjudications (control pair + the routed
cheap check). Three 2-2 split candidates
(inline blocking probe enumeration; codex name-only vouch forgeability; the
un-claim "emits NOTHING" test-artifact claim) are NOT adjudicated — listed in
#262 for the next whole-codebase review to re-derive.

False pid (a forking shell) self-heals via the resurrect path.

Mechanizes the invariant (cf. #273). NIT not defect — `dashboard_line` draws the `[cw]` text label as the primary disambiguator — but fixed anyway per future-proof→do-it.

| R0613-08 | `source/codewhale.rs` `decode_cw_subagent` parent_id ↔ shim cwd-fallback | the subagent→parent link resolves only if the child's `workspace` string byte-matches the parent's shim-resolved cwd; under a no-`-C` launch the parent cwd comes from `current_dir()` (R0613-05) while the child carries CodeWhale's internally-resolved `workspace` (NOT through the shim) — they COULD diverge (trailing slash / symlink / abs-vs-rel), pointing parent_id at a non-existent slot | VERIFIED→#276 CLOSED | the user surfaced a REAL captured subagent run (`~/dotfiles/.deepseek/state/subagents.v1.json`: child `agent_ad945f4c`, workspace `/Users/navepnow/dotfiles`). Upstream `ui.rs::execute_subagent_observer_hook` emits `workspace = context.workspace.display()` (the same `App.workspace` that backs `DEEPSEEK_WORKSPACE`), and `/Users/navepnow/dotfiles` is not a symlink (`realpath` == literal) so the shim's `current_dir()` == that string → **byte-match holds**. Child id is `agent_<hex>` (never collides with a `/`-path). Pinned by `real_codewhale_subagent_payload_nests_the_child_under_its_workspace_parent` (decodes the FULL upstream payload — 7+ fields — through `decode_hook_payload` → reducer, asserts the child nests). Residual (a workspace that IS a symlink where CodeWhale canonicalizes but `current_dir()` doesn't) degrades gracefully to an un-nested sprite — not a tracked defect.

## 2026-06-13 — opencode integration review @ 6183494 (feat/opencode-source) → PR pending

A 4-lens fan-out (correctness/grounding · design/blast-radius/semver ·
install+TS-plugin-artifact+cross-platform · liveness/lifecycle) over the whole
opencode diff, each MEDIUM+ adversarially verified. opencode is the 6th source —
HOOK-ONLY via a bundled TS plugin (the FIRST install target that ships CODE). The
event SHAPES are grounded in the cloned upstream source + the real persisted
`opencode.db` event log (a free-model self-run; the full tool+subagent LIVE
capture is confirm-before-merge, blocked on the throttled free tier). Result:
**0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 1 MEDIUM (held)**, all lenses APPROVE-WITH-NITS; all
findings fixed in-PR.

| # | seam (file/mechanism) | claim (1 line) | verdict | anchor (paths + fix) | tier | head | date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0613-09 | `hook/mod.rs` pid-bind only on `SessionStart` × opencode `resurrects_on_prompt:false` | a MID-ATTACHED opencode session registers via the prepended `Identity` (opencode emits `session.created` once per session, never re-emits it), so `HookPidWatch.note` — fired only on `SessionStart` — never binds its pid; on an abrupt TUI quit (no `session.deleted` either) the sprite ghosts to the 30-min sweep. Invisible for CodeWhale (its `message_submit` re-emits `SessionStart` every prompt) — genuinely new for opencode | CONFIRMED→fixed | bind on `Identity` too via the new pure `pid_bind_target(ev)` (SessionStart \| Identity) — the `_pid` is already on every forwarded event; `note` is idempotent per (pid,agent). Also hardens CodeWhale mid-attach. Pinned by `pid_bind_target_covers_both_registration_carriers`. Found by the liveness lens (c88), adversarially verified holds=true | A | 6183494 | 2026-06-13 |
| R0613-10 | `install/opencode_plugin.ts` tool-part gate + `source/opencode.rs` running→ActivityStart | opencode re-publishes a tool part with status STILL `running` on every output chunk (streaming `bash`/`task`, upstream `prompt.ts`), so the plugin forwarded one shim-spawn PER chunk and the reducer's `tool_call_count` over-counted (no per-callID dedup under the single Hook transport) — contradicting the "one connection per tool-state change" claim | CONFIRMED→fixed | the plugin now tracks last-seen status per `callID` (a `Map`, freed on terminal status) and forwards a tool part only on a status TRANSITION — collapses the spawn burst AND fixes the count. Grounded in upstream source (not schema-inference). Found by the correctness lens (c78) | B | 6183494 | 2026-06-13 |
| R0613-11 | `source/opencode.rs` `decode_permission` reason keys | the reason was read from `title`/`pattern`/`type`/`tool`/`permission`, but the real upstream `permission.v2.asked` schema (`Request.fields` = `{sessionID, action, resources, …}`) carries NONE of them — so Waiting reason ALWAYS degraded to the literal `"permission"` (the synthetic fixture's `title` never occurs upstream) | CONFIRMED→fixed | key order is now `["action","permission",…]` (the v2 verb + v1 name first); the conformance fixture uses the real `{sessionID, action, resources}` v2 shape (snapshot reason now `bash`); tests exercise both v2 `action` and v1 `permission`. Found by the design + correctness lenses (c80) | B | 6183494 | 2026-06-13 |
| R0613-12 | `source/opencode.rs` module doc | the module header still described the SUPERSEDED install design ("registers it in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`") — the install actually DROPS a plugin file in the auto-discovered `<config>/plugin/` dir, no jsonc edit | CONFIRMED→fixed | header corrected to the plugin-file-drop design. Plus two NIT doc/comment fixes (the `handle_conn` `_pid`-peek comment named only CodeWhale → CodeWhale+opencode; the `render_plugin` JSON⊂JS-string caveat re U+2028/U+2029, sound for filesystem paths). Found by the install lens (c96) | B | 6183494 | 2026-06-13 |
| R0613-14 | `install/opencode.rs` `default_config_path` plugin DIR name | installed to `<config>/plugin/` (SINGULAR) — taken from the anomalyco fork's permissive `{plugin,plugins}` source glob (so it loaded on the fork, live-proven) — but the CANONICAL opencode docs (opencode.ai/docs/plugins) auto-discover `<config>/plugins/` (PLURAL); canonical opencode would NOT load a singular-dir plugin → a silent no-op for non-fork users | CONFIRMED→fixed | `default_config_path` → `plugins/` (plural): works on the fork (brace glob) AND canonical. Re-verified live (plugin loads from `plugins/`, `oc·` sprite renders). **Found when the user asked "did you verify the official docs first?"** — I'd worked from the fork SOURCE + the real event log + a live e2e, NOT the docs; reading them surfaced the singular/plural divergence. LESSON: read the canonical docs BEFORE reverse-engineering a fork's (more-permissive) source — the fork's brace glob masked a portability bug | A | (post-2941cbb) | 2026-06-13 |
| R0613-13 | `install/opencode.rs` `detect_installed` (the `presence_probe`) | the auto-detect probe keyed on OUR plugin's `@pixtuoid-opencode-plugin` sentinel — so a bare `pixtuoid install-hooks` (auto-detect) would NEVER offer opencode until AFTER our plugin was already installed (chicken-and-egg); the opencode CLI itself was never detected. Every other source's `presence_probe` detects the CLI, not our artifact | CONFIRMED→fixed | `detect_installed` now probes opencode's OWN dirs (`<config>` + `~/.local/share/opencode`), like Reasonix/CodeWhale. `config_present`/uninstall use FILE-existence (unaffected) and `merge_uninstall` keys on the sentinel, so removal stays exact. **Found POST-merge-claim while the user asked "did we install the plugin?"** — the 4-lens install lens checked the sentinel logic but conflated "our plugin installed" with "the CLI is present." Reinforces R0613-05: for a hook-only source, real-use/live checks catch what code review (and green CI) miss — the case AGAINST merging on green alone | A | 722daac | 2026-06-13 |
| R0613-15 | `install/opencode_plugin.ts` `lastToolStatus` dedup-map key | the streaming-dedup Map is MODULE-LEVEL (one plugin process serves a parent AND its `task`-spawned child session concurrently) and was keyed on `callID` ALONE — two concurrent sessions sharing a `callID` would drop the wrong session's tool event | CONFIRMED→fixed (claude[bot] PR review, MEDIUM, flagged twice) | key on `sessionID:callID` (composite) — eliminates cross-session collision; entries still freed on terminal status. PLUS the bot's informational dead-code: `render_plugin`'s `serde_json::to_string(&str).unwrap_or_else("")` is infallible-but-if-hit-deploys-a-broken-`HOOK_PATH=""` → now propagates via `Result`. Re-verified live (composite-key plugin loads, `oc·` sprite renders; a 0-event run in between was a TEST-harness socket-reclaim race from a leftover `/tmp` socket — a 2nd headless instance over a stale socket degrades to transcript-only by design, not a product bug) | B | (post-29b90ae) | 2026-06-13 |
