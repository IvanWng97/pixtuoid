//! The ONE source→reducer pipeline spine both painters boot through.
//!
//! What deliberately STAYS caller-side, because the two painters genuinely
//! diverge there:
//! - **`boot_caps`**: the TUI measures the terminal (footer-subtracting,
//!   cap-clamped, headless arms); floating measures its window pixels — a
//!   deliberate divergence (reusing the TUI math over-seeds and strands agents on
//!   non-existent desks), so the pipeline takes the seed as a PARAMETER and must
//!   never compute it. It is also WHEN they diverge: floating cannot seed until a
//!   real window exists, so it calls this from `window::resumed`, not at boot.
//! - **socket resolution + `ConnectedSources`**: both values outlive the boot (the
//!   Sources panel displays the path and mutates the live set), so the callers own
//!   them and hand in a clone.
//!
//! Requires an ambient tokio runtime context — `run_async` executes inside
//! `block_on`, floating holds an `rt.enter()` guard — so the `tokio::spawn`s here
//! land on the caller's runtime either way.
