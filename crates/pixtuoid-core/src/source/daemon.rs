//! The shared, daemon-AGNOSTIC presence layer. A "daemon" source (the OpenClaw
//! gateway is instance #1) produces NO agent activity — it has no desk, no
//! `AgentSlot`. Instead each running daemon INSTANCE earns one presence-gated
//! wandering mascot whose motion encodes that instance's liveness. This module
//! owns the state machine + lifecycle identical for EVERY daemon; the per-daemon
//! WIRE decode stays in the daemon's own module, exactly like an agent source
//! owns its own line/hook decoder.
//!
//! Presence rides a SIBLING channel (invariant #2: NOT the one `AgentEvent`
//! channel), carrying `PresenceMsg { key: DaemonInstanceKey, delta }` so N daemons
//! AND N instances of one daemon land in DISTINCT `SceneState::daemons` entries.
//! The reducer task merges them via
//! [`apply_presence`](crate::source::daemon::apply_presence), NEVER through
//! `Reducer::apply` (which is `AgentId`-pure).
//!
//! **The two identity concepts are deliberately separate.** The
//! [`DaemonInstanceId`](crate::state::DaemonInstanceId) is STABLE — a gateway
//! restarting on the same port keeps its mascot — while
//! `DaemonPresence::current_pid` is the PROCESS incarnation, rebound by each
//! `GatewayUp`, so a late exit receipt for a replaced process is a no-op instead
//! of a kill of its replacement.
