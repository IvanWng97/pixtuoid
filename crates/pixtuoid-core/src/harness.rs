//! ONE offline driver for the owner's contract: *transcripts in → "did we
//! parse it AND would the UI show it" out.*
//!
//! ```text
//!   raw line → JSON → the registry's decoder → a real Reducer → SceneState
//! ```
//!
//! Whether the resulting scene would PAINT is the render layer's question,
//! asked one crate up; this half stops at the state the painter reads.
//!
//! Three things here are load-bearing rather than incidental:
//!
//! 1. **Registration comes from the WATCHER, not the decoder.** A JSONL event
//!    for an unknown id is a documented no-op, so a transcript driven with no
//!    seed registers nothing however well it decodes. [`Drive::seeded`] stands
//!    in for `emit_first_sight`, keyed by the SAME registry row the watcher
//!    reads, so the seed can't drift from production.
//! 2. **Transport is load-bearing** (the reducer's hook-wins dedup keys on it),
//!    so it is not a free parameter.
//! 3. **A decoder panic is a contract violation, everywhere.** The watcher and
//!    hook listener log-and-continue on malformed input; a panic takes the
//!    whole watcher down. Every line therefore runs under `catch_unwind`.
