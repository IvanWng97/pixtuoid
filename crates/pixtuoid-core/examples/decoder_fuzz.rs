//! Real-corpus never-panic harness for a source's transcript LINE decoder.
//!
//! The source is an ARGUMENT, never sniffed from line shape: inferring it
//! silently MISROUTED sources whose shape didn't match a hard-coded predicate
//! (grok's `method` envelope, omp's bare `type`) to `decode_cc_line`, reporting
//! a false-green "0 panics" having exercised the WRONG decoder.
//!
//! A TOOL, not a committed corpus — point it at any JSONL tree, e.g.
//! `just fuzz claude-code ~/.claude/projects`. `Driven` retains every decoded
//! event, so memory scales with the piped corpus; split a huge tree.
//!
//! Decode `Err` is allowed (the watcher logs + skips malformed lines); only a
//! PANIC is a contract violation.
