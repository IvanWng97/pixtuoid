# pixtuoid-core/tests — agent guide

Integration tests organized **by capability/layer**; the per-CLI dimension
lives where the actual variation is — the source fixtures. 9 test binaries
(each top-level `tests/*.rs` or `tests/<area>/main.rs` is one binary — a
multi-file area MUST be `<area>/main.rs`, because a top-level `<area>.rs` is a
crate root whose `mod foo;` resolves to a SIBLING `tests/foo.rs`):

```

```

Data scopes to the binary that reads it — a module-owned fixture lives with
its module. One cross-crate reader: `pixtuoid/tests/wire_to_pixels.rs` roots
at `sources/` (not `sources/fixtures/`) because it needs the two-sprite
captures the one-AgentId rule cannot host.

## The one pipeline

Real wire bytes ride `pixtuoid_core::harness::Drive` (dev-only `harness`
feature): `conformance.rs`, `sources/{grok,cursor,delegation}` (hardcoded
decoders until #929), `pixtuoid/tests/wire_to_pixels.rs`, and the on-demand
tools (`decoder_fuzz`, `corpus_check`). A shell supplies bytes and asserts;
it does NOT re-roll decode→reduce and never re-derives the first-sight seed's
`AgentId` (that comes from the source's registry row — core guide).
`benches/decode_reduce.rs` SYNTHESIZES its lines — a bench-shaped fixture
under `sources/fixtures/` would be mis-scanned.

## Adding a new agent CLI — the test steps

1. **Always:** `tests/sources/fixtures/<registered-source>/<scenario>/` — at
   minimum a RECORDED SessionStart scenario (`just capture-fixture`) with the
   `provenance.json` the recorder writes; a hook-only source's first recorded
   scenario also drops its `NO_WIRE_EVIDENCE_YET` entry. `conformance.rs`
   auto-discovers the dir; `supported_sources_manifest` forces the manifest
   row; `cargo insta review` accepts the snapshot. Dir name = registered
   source name (`claude-code`, not `claude`); transcript-bearing fixtures are
   driven WITH the first-sight seed, so a wrong `id_from_path` fails here
   instead of shipping two sprites for one session.
2. **Always:** a case row + `#[test] fn` in `pixtuoid/tests/wire_to_pixels.rs`
   (`wire_matrix_covers_every_registered_source` forces it), and settle
   `TOOL_ID_KEY_UNPROVEN` in `captures.rs`. The third roster literal is
   CONTRIBUTING.md checklist step 12, outside this tree.
3. **Only for unique behavior** (subagent hooks, custom lifecycle): a
   `tests/sources/<cli>/` module registered in `sources/main.rs`. Plain CLIs
   (antigravity, reasonix) need none.
