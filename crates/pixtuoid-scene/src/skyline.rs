//! The city seen through the office's windows: which buildings stand where
//! along the window run, far to near, which of their windows burn, each depth's
//! colours under the sky, and the city drawn onto an art grid of any density.
//! The classic painter lays that grid on its buffer at 1x, so one city is what
//! every window shows.
//!
//! Everything is laid out in logical units from the run's west end and the
//! glass's top, and every choice is a hash of where it is, so a wider window
//! shows more of the same city rather than another one. How tall the city
//! stands is a share of the glass, plane by plane, so a short window crops its
//! towers and a tall one shows them whole over more sky.
