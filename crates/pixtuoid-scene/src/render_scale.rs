//! room sharper, it would build a room with several times the desks, and
//! "render the same office with more detail" would be unexpressible. Pinned by
//! `floor_capacity_is_invariant_under_render_scale` and its negative control
//! `without_the_seam_a_bigger_buffer_builds_a_bigger_office`.
//!
//! [`RenderScale`] splits the axis. Layout keeps computing in logical units, so
