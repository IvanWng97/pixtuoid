//! The enriched orthographic cutaway profile — a SIBLING of the classic
//! half-block painter, not a fidelity knob on it. Both read
//! `sim::SimFrame`.
//!
//! `render_cutaway`, `CutawayCanvas` and the screen-text sink (`paint_grid`
//! in a `Face`) are `#[doc(hidden)] pub` as seams for out-of-crate drivers
//! (the snapshot example, the render bench, the binary's font-coverage test,
//! the painters) — MECHANISM, not a promise to a crates.io consumer. `shade` has no
//! cross-crate caller and stays `pub(crate)`: a `pub` item on a published crate
//! is the one thing a follow-up cannot quietly undo.
