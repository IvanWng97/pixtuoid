//! The glass room partition's look, pixel-free: what the glass does to
//! each cell of a [`WallPiece`]'s box. Both painters
//! walk their own grid over that box and ask it, so the glass is one design
//! drawn at two densities.
//!
//! The panes are see-through: a pane cell is what lies behind it, stepped up
//! its own ramp ([`Rgb::ramp`]), so a figure behind the glass keeps its hues
//! and a cell that was one colour stays one. Only the frame — the rim, posts
//! and sill — and a face-on pane's glint are colours of their own, drawn from
//! the theme's trim.
