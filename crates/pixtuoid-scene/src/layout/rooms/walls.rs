//! Request-based room walls: each room DECLARES the edges it needs enclosed
//! (horizontal/vertical runs only) plus the doors it wants in them; the
//! resolver merges duplicate requests, unions their door requests, trims
//! vertical runs below crossing horizontal wall bodies, and cuts the gaps.
//! Walls are therefore a FUNCTION of the room set, never parallel geometry
//! derived from the same scalars the rooms were.
//!
//! Door policy is the ROOMS' (owner call): a meeting room opens a centered door
//! in its east (corridor) wall; the pantry opens the meeting↔pantry door at 60%
//! of the shared wall; two stacked meeting rooms declare NO door on their shared
//! wall — each already has its own corridor door, so connectivity holds.
//!
//! The mask and both painters read the one [`WallPiece`] built per wall, so the
//! ground they block and the glass they draw meet the same joints. The glass's
//! look is `crate::glass`, and nothing here touches a pixel.
