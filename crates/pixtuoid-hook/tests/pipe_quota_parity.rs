//! Pins the shim's stdin-cap arithmetic AGAINST the daemon's Windows
//! named-pipe in-buffer quota, cross-crate: the shim caps stdin so a stamped
//! wire line always fits `IN_BUFFER_SIZE` and its sync write can't stall on
//! quota (stall → 200ms watchdog → the event is silently dropped).
//!
//! The daemon's source can't be `#[path]`-included here — windows.rs needs
//! tokio/windows-sys and the shim must stay dependency-free — so this pins the
//! three DEFINITION LINES textually instead. Deliberately fail-loud on a
//! rename/move too: a drift guard that silently stops guarding is worse than
//! one that asks to be re-pointed.
//!
//! Workspace-only (reads a sibling crate's source): excluded from the
//! published tarball via this crate's Cargo.toml `exclude`.
